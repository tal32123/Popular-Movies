# PopularMovies3

This app shows a list of popular movies based off of different sorting paramaters (Most popular, highest rated, and favorites).
Once a movie is clicked, the app shows more details on the chosen movie.
All of this is pulled off the internet and synchronizes with the server once a day as the movie database is only updated once a day.

## Installation
* Get an API key for [the movie database](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
* Insert API key into the App's build.gradle file in the area marked: "\"INSERT MOVIE DB API KEY HERE\"" Ex. "\"1234567\""
